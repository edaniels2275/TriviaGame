# TriviaGame

1. The game begins when the user presses the start button.

2. The user has 11 seconds to answer each question, with a timer counting down.

3. When the user selects their answer, a screen comes up in the question area that tells the user if they are correct or incorrect. This screen is displayed for three seconds before automatically moving on to the next question and the countdown restarts from 11. 

4. When the user answers all six questions, a "play again" button appears and if they click it the game then restarts.
